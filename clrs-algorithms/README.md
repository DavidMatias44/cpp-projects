I am currently reading "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein. This repository contains my implementations of the algorithms and data structures explained in this book.

## Structure
clrs-algorithms/
|---- include/
|---- src/

## Build instructions.
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DavidMatias44/cpp-projects
    cd cpp-projects/clrs-algorithms
    make
    ./output
```
Optional:
```bash
    make clean
```

## Notes.
- This is a personal learning project, but suggestions are welcome! Just be kind, please.
- Implemented using modern C++ for learning purposes too.
