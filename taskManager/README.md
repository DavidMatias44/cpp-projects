> This folder is part of a larger repo. This `README.md` refers only to the `taskManager/` subdirectory.

**TaskManager** is a very simple C++ command-line application for managing tasks.

## Motivation

This project was developed to practice object-oriented programming and build automation using Makefiles.

## Features

- Create, list and modify tasks
- Basic terminal interface.
- Structured using C++ classes and header files.
- Built using Makefiles.

## Build instructions

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DavidMatias44/cpp-projects
    cd cpp-projects/taskManager
    make
    ./output
```

Optional:
```bash
    make clean
```

## Requirements
- A C++17-compliant compiler.
- Standard C++ libraries only (no external dependencies).
- GNU Make (no need for CMake or external build systems).

## Notes
- This project was created for educational purposes.
- It can be extended to support file persistence, better error handling or advanced CLI features.
